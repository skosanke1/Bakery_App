Setting up environment:
If this is the first time setting up the virtual machine, then you need to install Docker on the machine first.
Make sure the machine is accessible locally on the network (bridged adapter)
Copy the entire directory into the machine. The following commands can be run within the project main directory.


Docker:
docker run -p 8080:ABAB server:spring-docker . run the docker container on port ABAB
docker ps - creates a list of running containers
docker kill <CONTAINER ID> - stops the container

Maven: (Requires Maven)
./mvnw spring-boot:run - runs the app using Maven
mvn spring-boot:build-image
./mvnw clean package - cleans and rebuilds the jar executable file (rename target/spring-boot-docker.jar) 


Setup: (Terminal commands)
sudo apt install apt-transport - allows the use of repositories accessed via the HTTP Secure protocol (HTTPS)
sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami) - add the user to docker group (Use is docker server is non-responsive)
hostname -I - check the IP of the machine, connect over TCP using inet v6 192.168.X.X
